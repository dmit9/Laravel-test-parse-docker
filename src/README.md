Brief description of the service:

"The price parsing service is designed to process data from external resources. The user initiates parsing by clicking a button on the web page. 
The Laravel controller passes the request to the ParseService service, which processes the data via HTTP requests to external URLs. 
The processed data is saved in the database and returned to the user's page for display. The service supports queuing tasks to improve performance."


1. Price parsing service
   Description of work:
   
The user registers by entering an email and a link.
A confirmation of registration is sent to the email.
The user clicks the "Get Price" button.
The browser sends a request to the controller via Laravel routing.
The controller calls the ParseService service, which:
Receives a list of users.
For each user, parses data from external links.
Saves updated data to the database.
If the data has changed, the user is sent a letter with a new price.
After parsing is complete, the data is returned to the user and displayed on the page.
